            "Everybody's talking about artificial intelligence these days, AI. Machine learning is another hot topic. Are they the same thing or are they different? And if so, what are those differences? And deeplearning is another one that comes into play. I actually did a video on these three, artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning. And there were a lot of comments on that, and I'd like to address some of the most frequently asked questions. A machine learning algorithm is really good at looking at patterns and discovering patterns within data. The more training data you can give it, the more confident it can be in predicting. Machine learning really came along and became more popularized in this time frame, in the 2010s. The most recent advancements in the field of artificial intelligence all really are in this space, the area of generative AI. Generative AI can generate new content out of existing information. This is where chat bots and deepfakes come from. It's really useful in entertainment situations, in parodies and things like that. But there's also a lot of cases where this stuff could be abused. And the thing for us to understand is where this is, where it fits in, and make sure that we can reap the benefits from all of this technology.\n"

I actually did a video on these three, artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning, and talked about where they fit. Well, it could be a lot of different things, but generally we tend to think of it as the ability to learn, to infer, and to reason, things like that. In our series of letters from African-American journalists, film-maker and columnist Steve Kroft looks at some of the technologies that are changing the way we live and work, including machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence, and how they're changing the way we think about technology and how we work with it. Neural networks are ways that in a computer we simulate and mimic the way the human brain works, at least to the extent that we understand how the brain works. In our series of interviews with leading scientists, Google's artificial intelligence researcher and co-founder DeepMind's Vint Cerf explains how chat bots and deepfakes are part of generative AI, and why they're not just \" regurgitating existing information\", as some have suggested. The possibilities of generating new content, or in some cases, existing content and giving us something that is bite size and manageable.\n"
